start PSQL prompt:
```shell
psql -U michaelpalumbo -d forkingpaths
```

get table names:

```shell
\dt
```

Return the synth_templates data (excluding the synthJson data, which is massive):
```shell
SELECT id, name, author, description, tags, created_at
FROM synth_templates
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

```


connect to render instance of database

```shell
psql "postgresql://forkingpaths_user:pfbyuQdv5KFgHENfU4bHeEdhaPVsJpHa@dpg-d0buifhr0fns73dso930-a.ohio-postgres.render.com/forkingpaths"

```


when adding a table to the remote database, first get the info about it from the local psql
```shell
# don't enter this into the psql prompt, run it from the CLI
pg_dump -s -t synth_templates forkingpaths

or

pg_dump -s -t patch_histories forkingpaths
# from that output, i was able to then confidently make this command to enter into the remote psql prompt:
CREATE TABLE synth_templates (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    author TEXT,
    description TEXT,
    tags TEXT[],
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    synth_json JSONB NOT NULL
);
# then in the remote prompt run this
\dt

# then this
SELECT * FROM synth_templates;

# verify its there
```


```sql
# erase all rows from table

TRUNCATE patch_histories RESTART IDENTITY;

```



```shell

```
